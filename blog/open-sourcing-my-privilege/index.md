# Open Sourcing My Privilege
Jan 8, 2022

I have privilege. It‚Äôs a non-zero reason for where I am today. 

On the flip side, I‚Äôve found that I suffer from privilege guilt, and it‚Äôs held me back from objectively high impact actions. I‚Äôve been in fear of others thinking my success undeserved. 

I‚Äôd like to assert that my success extends beyond the privileges I started with, though one could aways argue that privilege is everything. 

It‚Äôs a valid argument.

I‚Äôm not here to determine if that argument is right or wrong, but I do want to open-source my own privileges and experiences to allow myself and others to make their own conclusions as to how deserved my success is.

By opening myself up for privilege criticism, my intention is to free myself from the fear of it, so I can move forward into 2022 and the future without reservations.

### My Transition to Self-Sufficiency

**Synopsis:** I went straight into startup after undergrad and hit runway zero multiple times

Note: a lot of my personal finances and business finances were mixed until 2020, so this self sufficiency is intertwined with my startup finances

- I became living-expense self-sufficient halfway through undergrad
    - Due to two engineering internships
        - First hiring manager was unrelated to me, so I was hired fully off of merit
        - Second hiring manager was a cousin‚Äôs frat bro so maybe it wasn‚Äôt 100% merit
    - Parents continued to pay my tuition
- I spent my savings from pig revenues, farm income, and internship income to fund:
    - Two study abroads (Spain, Singapore)
    - Worldly travel (~25 countries)
    - Half of a failed invention Patent during my first startup
    - A summer spent building a motorcycle and traveling instead of working a third internship
- I graduated undergrad in 2018 with no student debt, and ~5 months of personal Iowa runway
- I never got a full time job, instead opting to be a solo startup founder
- My parents invested $15k as my first angels
    - They did so reluctantly, and would otherwise never invest in a venture scaled startup

    - About a year of this
    - I lived on rice, eggs, and beans for the year
    - Occasional gifts from parents to support added up to about $5k through the year
    - On my birthday, friends and family sent me gifts of a few months worth of rice, eggs, and beans
    - This is when my mental health began to decline
- I moved up into another hacker house San Francisco
- I hit runway zero a second time
- I became $15k in credit card debt

    - which I secretly added to their $15k investment to make it $20k

    - And six months behind on rent
    - SF housing rules dictated that they couldn‚Äôt kick me out

- I moved to Mexico City to extend runway
- Through 2020 I earned about $3k worth of crypto from a startup mentor in weekly [f.inc](http://f.inc) shipping competitions
- I hit runway zero a fourth time
- My crypto winnings had grown, so I bootstrapped on exclusively that for about three months
- I landed our third angel investment, for $15k
- My startup, [Banana](http://banana.dev) (formerly [Booste](http://booste.io)) finally took off
- I got accepted into [Pioneer.app](http://pioneer.app/)
    - Would have hit runway zero a fifth time had it not been for cloud credits
- I raised a $240k pre-seed round
    - Paid myself just enough to survive comfortably
    - No savings, skipping payroll when possible
- I raised an oversubscribed $1.7m seed round
    - Still paying myself breakeven income
    - No savings
- Finally got to move around a bit, and spent a few months living in SF, Paris and Florence
- Now 2022, I‚Äôm moving back to Mexico City
    - Not because of money, but because I love it there
    - I don‚Äôt plan to take a pay cut from my current SF income, so I will finally have savings

### Conclusion

I had a whole lot of help initially, tempered by a rocky patch 2018 - 2021, but I believe it is fair to say that I‚Äôm independently creating my own future from now onward.

**Privilege that will always apply:**

- My visible demographics
- My US citizenship
- Momentum from my education
- The worst case scenario safety net of moving back in with my parents

**Things I‚Äôve earned for myself:**

**Experientially:**

I run ultramarathons and live out of a backpack as an international digital nomad

**Socially:**

My entire network right now was built from zero starting when I moved to California

**Financially:**

My net worth has surpassed that of my parents, with the most recent Banana valuation

### Here ends my open-sourced privilege audit.

If it still upsets you, that‚Äôs fine.

I‚Äôm going to do my best to use it for good.
