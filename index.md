# Erik Dunteman

I'm a founder and engineer focused on developer tools, cloud computing, and AI.

Most notably, I built [Banana](https://banana.dev), one of the first and most loved Serverless GPU platforms. We helped more than 3000 teams deploy their AI models to GPUs for inference.

I'm now working with [Modal](https://modal.com) to help show the world the power of self-provisioning infra.

### Side Interests
- I enjoy drinking water (no ice)
- I'm an endurance runner, currently training for a [50 mile ultramarathon](https://www.spartantrail.com/golden-gate-trail-classic). This will be my third attempt at this distance.
- I'm building [Internet Over Laser](https://x.com/erikdunteman/status/1824296804151972054). As AI inference becomes a more common form of compute, the cost and energy requirements of hardware make it harder to run that compute on-device, shifting it instead to the cloud. We'll need high-throughput wireless networks to support this. Though for now, this is purely a for-fun project.
- I believe [Zig](https://ziglang.org) is the next big thing in software. I'm a sucker for simple languages that get the job done.
- My wife!
