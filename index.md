# Erik Dunteman

I'm a founder and engineer focused on developer tools, cloud computing, and AI.

Most notably, I built [Banana](https://banana.dev), one of the first and most loved Serverless GPU platforms. We helped more than 3000 teams deploy their AI models to GPUs for inference. Following that, I had the privilege to work with our former competitor [Modal](https://modal.com), learning what excellence looks like.

I am currently building [Muscle Memory](https://github.com/pig-dot-dev/muscle-mem), a behavior cache that helps AI agents efficiently learn and reuse skills. We participated as [Pig.dev](https://pig.dev) in YC W25 batch.

### Side Interests
- I'm an endurance runner, most recently finishing a [50 mile ultramarathon](https://www.spartantrail.com/golden-gate-trail-classic).
- I'm spent 2024 on fun projects like [Internet Over Laser](https://x.com/erikdunteman/status/1824296804151972054). As AI inference becomes a more common form of compute, the cost and energy requirements of hardware make it harder to run that compute on-device, shifting it instead to the cloud. We'll need high-throughput wireless networks to support this.
- I believe [Zig](https://ziglang.org) is the next big thing. I'm a sucker for simple languages that get the job done, and if that job requires manual memory management, I'm most excited to reach for Zig.
- My wife! In 2020 I moved to Mexico City expecting to stay for a month, but life had different plans for me. In that month I met a lovely lady, fell in love, and ended up staying for two years! We now live in San Francisco, and enjoy dancing salsa and cleaning the house on Sunday.
